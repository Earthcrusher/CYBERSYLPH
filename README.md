# CYBERSYLPH
CYBERSYLPH (yep, stylized in all-caps) is a riotous party in the sky, and everyone's invited. At least until the world ends. CYBERSYLPH is made with the [Europa Station](https://github.com/Yonaguni/EuropaStation) codebase, and strives to maintain as much compatibility with them as humanly possible.
